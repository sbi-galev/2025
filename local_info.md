## Travelling to Bristol
If you are travelling from London, there is a fast train connection (1,5 - 2 hours) from London Paddington. The central train station is Bristol Temple Meads.

If you have to arrive to London by plane and then take the train to Bristol, Heathrow is the easiest airport to do so, as there is an express connection to Paddington. Keep in mind that train strikes are never off the table, but they are announced at least two weeks in advance and there are alternative routes in case this happens.

Bristol has good flight connections to continental Europe. Bristol airport is served very well by bus A1 that takes you to Bristol city center in about 30'. You can buy a ticket by contactless payment or cash in the bus. We recommend a return ticket; it can be used within 30 days and is a better value. Make sure to explicitly ask for a receipt.

If you are travelling from USA, the easiest route is to get a connecting flight through Dublin (Air Lingus).

## Accommodation
You might want to book hotel accommodation early. There are hotels and airbnb accommodations close by.

A close by hotel is The Berkley Square Hotel. If you are looking for an economical option, you might consider the Premier Inn, which is not listed on Booking.com.

## Sights
The landmark of the city is the [Clifton Suspension Bridge](https://cliftonbridge.org.uk/)https://cliftonbridge.org.uk/), built in 1835. You will also see river Avon, which has the second strongest tide in the world, reaching a height difference of 10m, almost everyday. A spot with a nice view can be reaching by using `Bristol BS8 4NW` on your GPS.

The [floating harbour](https://visitbristol.co.uk/your-visit/areas/harbourside/floating-harbour) is located centrally, and makes for a nice walk or run (~4.5km / 3 miles between the two bridges).
You'll also get to see [The Matthew](https://matthew.co.uk/), a replica of the Cabot's boat that crossed the Atlantic in 1497, and the SS Great Britain.

Bristol is known for alternative artists, including Massive Attack, Portishead, and Banksy. You can take a [self-guided Banksy walking tour](https://visitbristol.co.uk/things-to-do/banksy-walking-tour-p1354013), the city is dotted with stunning murals from many local artists.
