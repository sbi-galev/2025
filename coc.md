# Code of Conduct

SBI-galev is a community meeting intended for networking and collaboration.
We value the participation of each member of our small community, and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meeting.

All attendees, speakers, organisers and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct, based on that produced for [NAM2023](https://nam2023.org/nam2023/code-of-conduct).
The organisers are committed to enforcing this code throughout the event, and any decision taken by the organisers in respect of it is final.
 
## Code of Conduct

The organisers of SBI-galev are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or nationality.
We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.
In particular, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate during any meeting activity, including during any informal social gatherings outside the official programme.

Meeting participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the meeting organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group, such as (but not limited to) gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or nationality. This includes sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes.
- Comments made, either through speech or chat on any meeting-related online platform (including social media), that are exclusionary, derogatory, or threatening toward another participant or community.
- Sexual language and imagery.
- Violent threats or language directed against another person, including incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm.

All SBI-galev participants, including exhibitors and guests, are subject to the anti-harassment policy.
If an individual is made aware that they are contravening these guidelines or making participants uncomfortable, they are expected to desist immediately.

The SBI-galev organisers retain the right to take any actions to maintain a welcoming environment for all participants.
This includes warning the offender, at the sole discretion of the organisers, or expulsion from the meeting with no refund.
